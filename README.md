# CritterStimulation
This was a final project as part of course taken at udx Final Project - Animal Kingdom
I was to write a set of classes that define the behavior of certain animals. that would run on a given a simulation of a world
with many animals wandering around in it.Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways and you are defining those differences.

Every object in this world is a "critter", where Critter is the super class with default behavior defined. 
I was to write child classesof Critter and override the methods according to some specifications
